**Single-source stories (not included):**
- 62 events were clustered but only reported by one source
- These are filtered out to maintain objectivity
- Examples might include: opinion pieces, exclusive interviews, single-outlet investigations

**Why multi-source matters:**
- Reduces risk of misinformation
- Confirms factual accuracy
